# Bikes_Data_Warehouse_ETL
Python Script to first extract the data from CSV files and then perform the transformations (ET)  and SCD and finally load the data in a data warehouse of SQL server.
Creation of  a small Datawarehouse in Microsoft SQL server which is functionally and technically able to answer the Business Questions related to the Dataset. Assumption is source files will come from the OLTP system time to time and then we will have to process them and load them into an Operational Data Store. From Operational Datastore I have created a DataMart/Data Warehouse which connects with the Reporting tool MicroStrategy which answers the Business question on this Data. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83393290/186273417-e29f0a6f-cb4b-4b1f-be46-c32ac4075abb.png)
